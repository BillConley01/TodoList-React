# TodoList-React
Todo List created in React
<p>This is the code for a basic TODO list made with React. It originated from an assignment in Week #14 of MIT's MERN Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to refactor out components, personalize features, and add styling.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>React useState is used to maintain state of the list and input values for new items.</li>
<li>Buttons were added to remove and add items to the list.</li>
<li>Two color shadow boxes and gradients were used to give an Neurmorphic look to the form and buttons.</li>
<li>Components were refactored to an input form, list item, header, and plus and minus buttons</li>
</ol>
